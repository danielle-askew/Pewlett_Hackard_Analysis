# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
Using SQL- relational databases to determine the number of employees retiring at Pewlett Hackard. 
Looking at birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.

## Overview of the analysis:
In this project we are helping Bobby in the Humans Resources department at Pewlett Hackard. The company wants to prepare for several employee retirements and want to define how many employees are retiring and which departments they work. 

## Results:
The queries that we constructed in this project have indicated that the "silver tsunami"  is coming for Pewlett Hackard.

![No. of Titles Retiring](Data/Titles_Retiring.png)

As we can see a total of 90,398 employees are about to retire from the company.

The bulk of the retiring employees are "Senior Engineers" (33%) or "Senior Staff" (31%), indicating the departure of a significant portion of experiential knowledge. Recruiting will need to work hard to counter this brain-drain.

Fortunately only two managers are retiring, minimizing need to train new leadership.

The number of employees eligible for the mentorship program are few (1549) in comparison to the number of employees retiring.

Summary:

At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come. 
According to the analysis of the data provided in the CSV files, there may be as many as 90,398 employees retiring within the next year. This is an extraordinarily large number of vacancies to fill. However, PH may be able to save some time and money in the long run by conducting a review of roles and positions. Some positions may be phased out, unnecessary projects should be terminated (along with the roles associated with them), and some responsibilities may be able to be transferred to existing staff. Before such a study is conducted, it's hard to say exactly how many roles will need to be filled.

There are over 1500 "qualified, retirement-ready employees" for the mentorship program. However, without knowing how many locations these employees are spread over, it's hard to begin to design such a project. Location information was, unfortunately, not included in the original CSVs. Assuming even distribution across all offices and departments:

If PH attempted to fill all vacancies, there would be a 58:1 trainee to mentor ratio
If PH attempted to only fill 60% of the vacancies, it could reduce the trainee-to-mentor ratio to 35:1.
Two additional tables that could prove useful in preparing for the coming "Silver Tsunami" are as follows: Retiring Employees by Department

A table showing how many employees are retiring by department, which indicates that Development and Production teams are going to see the biggest losses.
Retiring Employees Salaries Summation

A table showing the total salaries of all the retiring employees. The grand total is in the billions. As long as PH spends less than this on hiring replacements, it's saved money.
The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
